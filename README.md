<b>Ambient lighting</b>

Task: \
Create an additional hardware unit for the STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE kit, which is programmable mood lighting with three high brightness RGB LEDs. \

Requirements: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The executable lighting programs should be editable on PC, the hardware should communicate with PC via serial port. The serial
virtual serial port for serial communication, which can be connected to the USB port on the USB port! \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The programs created in this way are stored in an I2C EEPROM or SPI Flash memory. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The device should be able to generate an emulation program without programming, which the nature of which can be set by means of a push-button. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Use the same button to switch between downloaded lighting programs. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Design, construction and installation of the circuit prepare a test program system for demonstration purposes to demonstrate the device, including a microcontroller program to ensure proper operation and a PC client program.
